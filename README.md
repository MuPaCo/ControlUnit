# DevOpt Control Unit
The [DevOpt-project](http://www.devopt-projekt.de) aims at an approach for the development and operation of so-called controlled emergent systems.
That means an approach for complex and hierarchical software systems, which are under control of superior instances, but yield new behavior based on their own adaptation.
For that purpose, an emergent and distributed system is understood as a three-layered architecture, which consists of a local (IoT) layer, a control layer, and a DevOps layer.

A control unit in the DevOpt-approach realizes the logical concepts of the control layer in practice.
This repository hosts the code of such a control unit.
