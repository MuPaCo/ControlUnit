# Standard information is any log entry, which provides basic
# information, warning, and error messages produced by the
# controller and its components.
# 
# If this property is not defined, the default value will be
# used.
#
# Valid values:
#     n - No stream (no output)
#     s - Use the "standard" output stream of the host
#         environment
#
# Default value: s
logging.standard =

# The type of stream to use for logging debug information.
# Debug information extends the standard information above by
# additional debug information produced by the controller and
# its components.

# If this property is not defined, the default value will be
# used.
#
# Valid values:
#     n - No stream (no output)

##############################################################

# The type of protocol to use for listening for registrations
# of local elements to supervise by the controller. Any local
# element that needs to be supervised (monitored and
# controlled) by the controller must register itself at the
# controller via sending its model representation. The model
# receiver of the controller therefore provides a dedicated
# network connection, which uses the protocol defined by this
# property.
#
# If this property is not defined, the default value will be
# used.
#
# Valid values:
#     MQTT - Use the MQTT protocol; this creates an internal
#            MQTT client to subscribe to a dedicated
#            registration topic of an external broker
#     HTTP - Use the HTTP protocol; this creates an internal
#            HTTP server for receiving registrations via a
#            POST request of the local element to a dedicated
#            HTTP server context
#
# Default value: HTTP

# registration of local elements.
# The interpretation of this property's value depends on the

#              connect to; hence, it must start with "tcp://"
#     If HTTP: the URL defines the internal HTTP server to
#              create; hence, it must not start with "http://"
#              or "https://", but represent a valid IP or
#              machine name, like "www.example.com"
#

# used.
#

#              POST request of local elements must use this
#              path in combination with the 'registration.url',
#              e.g., http://127.0.0.1/registration
#

##############################################################

# The type of protocol to use for sending aggregated runtime
# data from the local elements to a desired receiver, like a
# database, dashboard, higher-level element, etc. Aggregation
# aims at providing runtime data with added value, e.g. the
# calculated state of an entire set of local elements instead
# of the raw states of each individual element. The aggregator
# of the controller performs such calculations and can 
# distribute the results via a dedicated network connection,
# which uses the protocol defined by this property.
#
# This property is optional. If aggregated data shall be
# distributed, all 'aggregation.*' properties must be defined
# to enable the creation of a working network connection.
#
# Valid values:
#     MQTT - Use the MQTT protocol; this creates an internal
#            MQTT client to publish to a dedicated aggregation
#            topic of an external broker
